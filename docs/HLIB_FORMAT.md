# `.hlib` — HackerOS Lib

**Status:** v1 (`hlib_spec_version: 1`)
**Scope:** a single, language-neutral library-archive format shared by three independent HackerOS language toolchains — **H#**, **Hacker Lang**, and **HackerScript**. Each toolchain ships its own independent, unpublished implementation of this spec (see "Why three implementations, not one crate" below) — this document is the one thing genuinely shared between them.

## 1. Container

A `.hlib` file is a `tar` archive, whole-stream compressed with `zstd` (level 19 by default). That's it — no custom magic bytes, no bespoke binary framing. `file mylib.hlib` correctly reports "Zstandard compressed data"; `zstd -d mylib.hlib -o mylib.tar && tar tf mylib.tar` works with stock tools for manual inspection.

## 2. Entries

| Path | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | yes | Everything below, in one place |
| `CHECKSUMS.sha256` | yes | `<hex-sha256>  <path>` per line, one per artifact, **sorted by path** |
| `SIGNATURE.ed25519` | no | Raw 64-byte Ed25519 signature over `CHECKSUMS.sha256`'s exact bytes |
| `native/<target-triple>/<name>.so` | no | Compiled shared object, one per target |
| `bytecode/<name>.hlbc` | no | Hacker Lang bytecode |
| `ast/...` | no | Producer-language source-level representation (see §5 — encoding differs per language) |
| `headers/<name>.iface.json` | no | Standalone copy of `manifest.exports`, for tooling that wants just the interface |
| `extra/...` | no | Anything else (docs, license, ...), passed through unmodified |

`manifest.json` is **not** included in `CHECKSUMS.sha256` — see §4 for why.

### The ABI-stable type set (`AbiType`)

`exports[].params`/`.returns` are lowered to a small, deliberately boring set every HackerOS language agrees maps to the same bit pattern: `i8 i16 i32 i64 u8 u16 u32 u64 f32 f64 bool void`, plus `ptr` (a raw byte pointer — strings/buffers, paired with a length per the producer's own convention) and `opaque { struct_name }` (an unresolved-layout handle, always passed by reference). Anything richer — generics, closures, language-specific struct layouts — has no entry here at all; it only exists in the `ast` artifact and is re-specialized by the *consumer's own* compiler.

## 4. Checksums and signing

`CHECKSUMS.sha256` covers every **artifact** entry (`native/…`, `ast/…`, `bytecode/…`, `headers/…`, `extra/…`) — deliberately **not** `manifest.json` itself. `manifest.json` already embeds each artifact's own `sha256`; excluding it sidesteps a circularity, since the final manifest bytes depend on whether a `signature` block is present, and that signature is computed *from* `CHECKSUMS.sha256`. A reader that wants to confirm `manifest.json` matches the archive it shipped with re-checks each `artifacts[].sha256` against `CHECKSUMS.sha256`'s lines — exactly what every reference reader's `verify_checksums()` does.

Signing is optional. When present, `SIGNATURE.ed25519` is a raw 64-byte Ed25519 signature over `CHECKSUMS.sha256`'s exact bytes. Verifying a signature only proves *this checksums file was signed by the holder of that private key* — it says nothing about whether that key should be trusted. Trust comes from the caller comparing the public key against one it already trusts (a lockfile pin, a declared publisher key, ...), the same way a package manager pins hashes today. No implementation invents or requires a trust store; that's left to each language's own package manager.

## 5. The `ast` artifact — one spec, three encodings

Every consumer needs a way to use a library's generics, macros, or (for source-hosted languages) its everyday functions without a rigid fixed-width ABI. That's what the `ast` artifact is for — but each language stores it in whatever shape its *own* front-end already parses, rather than forcing a shared cross-language AST schema that would need constant renegotiation as any one compiler evolves:

- **H#** (`ast/<name>.ast.json`): JSON array of `hsharp_parser::ast::Item` — the compiler's real AST type, which already derives `Serialize`/`Deserialize`. A consumer (H# itself) deserializes it back into real `Item`s and splices them into the program, byte-for-byte the same type the parser would have produced from source.
- **Hacker Lang** (`ast/<name>.ast.json`): JSON array of `hl_parser::Node` — same idea. Hacker Lang has no static type system, so this is usually the *primary* compiled artifact, not a fallback: its top-level `FuncDef`/`ArenaFuncDef` nodes are both the interface and something the runtime can execute directly.
- **HackerScript** (`ast/<name>.hcs`): the **original `.hcs` source text**, UTF-8, verbatim. HackerScript is self-hosted and still under active bootstrap, so its own AST node shapes change often; source text is the one representation its compiler is guaranteed to parse correctly at any point in its own development, with no separate schema to keep in sync. A consumer just parses this file the same way it parses any other `.hcs` file.

None of these are read cross-language. A Hacker Lang program consuming an H#-built `.hlib` never touches the `ast` artifact — it uses the `.so` + `headers` path instead (§6). The `ast` artifact is strictly a same-language fast path.

## 6. Consuming a `.hlib` — no `extern` required

Every language's compiler supports importing a `.hlib` directly (`use "hlib -> name"` in H#, `# <hlib/name>` in Hacker Lang, `get <hlib:name>` in HackerScript) without the program author writing any FFI declaration by hand. Resolution always tries two paths, in order:

1. **Same-language splice.** If the archive carries an `ast` artifact in *this* language's own encoding, the compiler deserializes/parses it and inlines the result directly into the program — same mechanism as a `mod`/`include` of a local file. Generics, macros, everything just works, because by the time typecheck runs, it *is* ordinary source in that language.
2. **Synthesized `extern` (fallback).** If there's no same-language `ast` artifact — a closed-source `.hlib`, or one produced by a *different* language — but there is a `.so` built for the host target, the compiler generates the FFI declaration **itself**, in memory, straight from `manifest.exports`, and links against the extracted `.so`. The program author still only wrote the one-line import.

Only non-generic function exports can be bound this way (`generic: true` exports need the `ast` path — there is no fixed-width call signature to generate for them). If neither path applies, the import fails with a clear error rather than silently doing nothing.

## 7. ABI stability — read this before assuming a `.so` is portable across languages

A compiled `.so`'s *symbol names* are consistent (plain, unmangled — H# and HackerScript both emit plain C-visible symbols for `pub`/exported functions), but each language's **calling convention for that symbol** is not automatically the same:

- **H#** and **HackerScript** exports use ordinary per-function typed C ABI — a `fn add(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64` is exactly that at the symbol level.
- **Hacker Lang**'s own FFI is a single fixed dispatch entrypoint, `hl_extern_call(argc: i32, argv: *const *const i8) -> i32` — string-marshalled, not a typed per-function ABI. A Hacker Lang program linking a foreign `.so` calls through that one entrypoint regardless of what the header lists; it does not call `add` directly by symbol.

Practically: H#-built and HackerScript-built `.so`s can usually be linked directly by each other's synthesized-`extern` path (§6.2). Calling either from Hacker Lang, or calling a Hacker Lang-oriented `.so` from H#/HackerScript, needs a small glue shim matching Hacker Lang's entrypoint convention — the format does not (yet) hide this difference. `manifest.exports[].signature` always tells you, in the producer's own words, what you're actually linking against.

## 8. Search paths

Every implementation searches, in order: a project-local `hlibs/` directory (walking up from the importing file), a package-manager-managed location when the ecosystem has one (H#'s `bytes` projects, HackerScript's `vira`-installed packages may ship a `.hlib` directly inside their installed directory), a per-user cache (`~/.hackeros/<Language>/hlibs/`), and a system-wide location (`/usr/lib/HackerOS/<Language>/hlibs/`). A `.hlib` sitting inside a `vira`/`bit`-installed package directory is picked up automatically — package-manager libraries are not a separate format from standalone `.hlib` files, just one more place the same file is looked for.

## 9. Why three implementations, not one shared crate

All three toolchains implement §§1–4 (the container/manifest/checksum/signature layer) identically in spirit, but as **independent, unpublished code** — not a shared crates.io package, and not a cross-repo path dependency:

- Nothing here is published externally; the format is HackerOS-internal.
- HackerScript bootstraps its own compiler from `.hcs` sources transpiled to Rust on the fly — a cross-repo Rust dependency would tie its build to a sibling checkout of another language's repo for no benefit, so its copy is instead a `native {Rust} [ ... ]` block embedded directly in its own compiler source (`hackerc/cmd/hlib.hcs`), using only ordinary crates.io algorithm crates (`sha2`, `tar`, `zstd`, `ed25519-dalek`, `hex`) pulled the same way any HackerScript program pulls a Cargo dependency (`get <crates:name::version>`).
- H#'s own compiler is expected to move to a self-hosted (H#-in-H#) implementation over time; keeping its `.hlib` module (`source-code/hlib/`) small and dependency-isolated means that eventual rewrite doesn't ripple into Hacker Lang or HackerScript.

If you're fixing a bug in one language's copy, check whether the same bug exists in the other two — they started from the same design but are not kept in sync automatically.
